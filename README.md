## Introduction
GDvent is a one-stop solution for organizing events at the Google Developer Students Club. It leverages Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a ticketing service, offering innovative and secure event certificates that cannot be faked. By using NFTs, GDvent increases the credibility of event certificates, encouraging students to participate in events, hackathons, and workshops.

As a Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) team, we are excited to introduce our new project, GDvent. This is an innovative one-stop solution for organizing events with the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as tickets. 

With the implementation of NFTs in event ticketing, it will become easier to verify attendees and increase credibility among participants. It also provides a secure way for users to buy tickets without fear of fraud or counterfeiting. 

 We have been working on this project since its inception and have encountered several major issues that need attention: Smart contract integration of add Event form; Tickets and the event's landing page; Bug fixes for Vercel production; Other major issues such as Home button at Navbar & Project documentation on GitHub etc.  

To get an idea about how this project works we recommend taking a look at our GitHub repository where you can find more information about these features including Solidity smart contracts which provide structure details regarding GDvent’s functionality. You can refer here https://web3.hashnode.com/solidity-tutorial-creating-an -ethereum -dapp -with –etherjs if you want further understanding regarding solidity smart contracts.   

 In conclusion, GDVent offers great potential in terms of providing efficient solutions when it comes to organizing events using NFT technology . We hope that by introducing this feature , we will be able to make sure smoother functioning during upcoming GDSC student events!
